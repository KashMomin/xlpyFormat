# xlpyFormat
This is library is written on top of openpyxl and xlsxwriter for formatting excel sheets.

openpyxl is created as very granular level to work with excel. Not all the time we like to customize this granular scripts for more customized requirements. for example, openpyxl works on cell level most of the time, but we feel comfortable to work on range, row, column or may be sheet level.

xlpyFormat is just a step to address few of these requirements.
